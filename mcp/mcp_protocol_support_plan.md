## 2. Product Positioning

- **Target Users**: Developers, designers, content creators, and anyone who needs to store, manage, and distribute images, especially those requiring image upload, download, and management via the MCP protocol.
- **Core Value**: Provide an efficient, stable, and secure image hosting service supporting the MCP protocol, enabling users to batch upload, download, and manage images through standardized protocols, enhancing automation and integration capabilities.
- **Application Scenarios**: Automated image uploading, CDN integration, third-party platform integration, batch image management, etc.

## 3. Requirements Definition

### 1. Functional Requirements

- Support basic operations such as image upload, download, deletion, and query via the MCP protocol.
- Maintain compatibility with existing APIs and add MCP protocol support.
- Manage image metadata (e.g., filename, size, upload time, URL, etc.).
- Implement permission and authentication mechanisms to ensure API security.
- Provide logging and error handling for troubleshooting.

### 2. Non-functional Requirements

- High availability and scalability.
- Comprehensive API documentation and good developer experience.
- Performance optimization to support large files and high concurrency.

## 4. API Documentation (MCP Protocol)

### 1. MCP Protocol Overview

MCP (assumed as "Media Control Protocol") is a standard protocol for media file management, supporting RESTful APIs.

### 2. Main Endpoints

#### 1. Image Upload

- **URL**: `POST /mcp/upload`
- **Headers**: `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`
- **Body**:
  - `file`: Image file
  - `token`: Authentication token
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "code": 0,
    "msg": "Upload successful",
    "data": {
      "url": "https://yourdomain.com/images/xxx.jpg",
      "id": "xxxx",
      "size": 12345
    }
  }
  ```

#### 2. Image Download

- **URL**: `GET /mcp/download/{id}`
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `token`: Authentication token
- **Response**: Image binary stream

#### 3. Image Deletion

- **URL**: `DELETE /mcp/delete/{id}`
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `token`: Authentication token
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "code": 0,
    "msg": "Delete successful"
  }
  ```

#### 4. Image Info Query

- **URL**: `GET /mcp/info/{id}`
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `token`: Authentication token
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "code": 0,
    "msg": "Query successful",
    "data": {
      "id": "xxxx",
      "url": "https://yourdomain.com/images/xxx.jpg",
      "size": 12345,
      "uploadTime": "2024-06-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
  }
  ```

## 5. Technical Implementation Plan

### 1. Backend

- **Protocol Adaptation**: Add MCP protocol-related routes (e.g., `/mcp/upload`, etc.) to the existing Node.js backend (`backend/server.js`).
- **Authentication Mechanism**: Use JWT or API Token to ensure API security.
- **File Storage**: Reuse existing OSS (e.g., Aliyun OSS, Qiniu Cloud, etc.) or local storage solutions.
- **Image Metadata Management**: Use MongoDB, MySQL, or local JSON files to store image information.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Unified response format and detailed operation logs.

### 2. Frontend

- **Management Interface**: Optional, provide MCP protocol testing tools or management interface for developers.
- **Documentation**: Supplement MCP protocol usage instructions in the frontend or as a separate document.
